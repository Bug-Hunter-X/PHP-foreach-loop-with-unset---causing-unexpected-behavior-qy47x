This repository demonstrates a common bug in PHP when using the unset() function within a foreach loop to remove elements from an array. The bug arises because unset() modifies the array indices during the loop iteration.  The solution provides a more robust approach using array_filter() to remove elements while avoiding index issues.  This is a great example to illustrate the importance of understanding how array manipulation functions work in PHP and to adopt more reliable and less error-prone practices.
